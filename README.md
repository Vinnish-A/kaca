# kaca

I’m starving, I’ve been sitting in front of a screen all day, and now
I’m going to go eat a Domino’s and help write the paperwork when I’m
done.

In short, this package mainly contains two functions, `kaca` and
`kada.`, `kaca` is used to capture and insert the picture on the
clipboard, and `kada` is used to switch the shutter mode.
