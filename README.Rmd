# kaca
 
In short, `kaca` is a shiny application which captures image or link, saves it to designated dir and inserts a url. For it is based on shiny and JavaScript, basically can be used on RStudio in any operating system (including RStudio Server).

## Usage

First, you need to set a shortcut key (if you don't want to run `kaca::kaca()` in the console every time), I highly recommend `Ctrl + Alt + C` or `Ctrl + B` (because these two are not commonly used by other softwares).You can search for `Insert pics from clipboard` in the `modify keyboard shortcuts` of RStudio to find `kaca`.

Then, assuming there is an image on your clipboard, that's great! You just need to press the shortcut key you set earlier to save the image and insert a quote. Remember to give your picture a meaningful name.

Because the method used here is image encoding and decoding to obtain and save images, it can't save animated images on the clipboard. This issue could be partially resolved by using the method of copying links below.

```{r fig.cap='Copy an image!'}
knitr::include_graphics('utils/images/pre1.gif')
```

If there is an image link on your clipboard, you can either directly insert the original link or download it to your local device before inserting a new link. The latter option won't take much effort.

```{r fig.cap='Copy a link and insert raw.'}
knitr::include_graphics('utils/images/pre2.gif')
```

Be sure to remember that any images saved locally need to have a meaningful name, unless you set `options('kacaMode' = 'auto')`. You can also set `options('kacaMode' = 'semi')` to revert back to the initial. But I believe this setting is generally not needed.

```{r fig.cap='Copy a link, download and insert it.'}
knitr::include_graphics('utils/images/pre3.gif')
```

## News! 

Now we have image hosting service in R. including `github` and `gitee`! You can use `Github Action` to reach other services for now.  

Use `edit_environ_github`/`edit_environ_gitee`/`edit_environ_githubAction` to configure environs. Note that in `githubAction` we do nothing but to replace the raw url to provided one, like: 

![](utils/images/20240726_conifg.png)

In which, you should designate `HOST_SERVICE` as github or gitee. 

The tutorial on connecting Github Action to Tencent Cloud can be found [here](https://blog.csdn.net/Tencent_COS/article/details/102714201), and I have conducted it, which is very convenient for writing Wexin articles.

## Plan

Add built-in support for other image hosting service.
